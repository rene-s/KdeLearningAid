Klaid - K Learning Aid
Pops up kvtml file items on the desktop. Use KWordQuiz or FlashKard to produce
kvtml files and load them into Klaid. It will grab all complete n x m
related items (e.g. "Question" and "Answer", or "Word A" and "Word B") and
displays them periodically as PopUps on the desktop. It is like someone is
sitting behind you making sure you know all the terms for your next exam or
test while surfing the web, coding, or whatever.

Installation
Extract the archive, run "make -f Makefile.cvs && ./configure --prefix=PATH"
first. Insert your KDE base installation dir for PATH. In Debian sid that would
be "/usr". Then compile by typing "make". You may then install the program (as
root) via checkinstall or "make install".

This program is GPL software. See COPYING for details.
